This is a public repository with Python code, output files, and data necessary to replicate the citation analysis appearing in:

> Barry Hashimoto, Kevin W. Gray, and Kafumu Kalyalya, "The International Criminal Court and the Justice Cascade."

To replicate the analysis on your computer, simply download this repository, keeping the `justice-cascade` directory name, and run `main.py`. The two output files that are already present in this repository will be reproduced.
